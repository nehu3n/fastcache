# FastCache - Key-Value Database

**FastCache** is a **blazing-fast**, **easy-to-use**, and **highly customizable** in-memory key-value database with **support for multiple caching algorithms**. It is entirely written in TypeScript and designed for **high performance** and **flexibility**. ðŸ”¥

## âœ¨ Features

- âš¡ **Blazing-fast performance:** Designed with **speed** in mind, **FastCache** is optimized for exceptional performance, making it ideal for applications that need fast data access. [Check out the benchmarks](./bench) to see how it compares to other cache packages in the ecosystem. **_(â‰ˆ8,000,000 operations per second ðŸ§ª)_**

- ðŸ‘€ **Easy-to-use API:** With a simple and intuitive API, **FastCache** offers a seamless and safe development experience, using **type-safe** TypeScript to reduce errors and make everyday work easier.

- ðŸŽ¨ **Highly customizable:** Tailor your cache with options like **TTL** (Time-To-Live) and **separate namespaces**. **FastCache** is adaptable to your application's specific needs, allowing you to maximize both performance and control.

- ðŸš€ **Multi-algorithm support:** It supports a variety of caching algorithms such as **LRU** (Least Recently Used), **2Q**, **LFU** (Least Frequently Used), **FIFO** (First In, First Out), and **ARC** (Adaptive Replacement Cache). This allows you to choose the algorithm that best fits your data access pattern or memory requirements.

- ðŸ“‚ **Persistence:** Provides an option for persistence through the file system. You can create ultra-efficient and targeted directory structures for searching, allowing you to maintain data consistency even when the application restarts.

## ðŸ“š Guide
